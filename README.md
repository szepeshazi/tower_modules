## Why this simulator

One of the many frustrating aspects of this game is rolling the desired substats (submodule effects that enhance the performance of your tower) on modules. Frustrating, because rolling requires a large amount of a specific in-game currency (reroll shards) that takes a long time to hoard.

This simulator lets you re-live the frustration of rolling for those effects, without the need for griding for reroll shards for weeks. Burn through millions of shardes without a care in the world!

The simulator tries to recreate the in-game experience as close as possible - I've tried to create a very close visual to the original effect rolling UI.

Enjoy!
